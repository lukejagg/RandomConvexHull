# RandomConvexHull

I made this in school probably around 3 years ago... 
I tried to create my own algorithm for creating convex hulls, which sorts each point of a point array into a quadrant, then starts in the 3rd quadrant and chooses the next point based on the angle. This works somewhat well for 2 dimensions, but isn't easily generalizable for higher dimensions.
